SDRAM

This module provides a PHY-level raw access to the SDRAM chip.

We used the MIG to generate a full controller. The MIG produces files
in the <project>.gen/sources_1/ip/mig/mig/user_design directory. From
there we copied:

- The constaints/mig.xdc file
- The complete rtl/phy directory
- The complete rtl/clocking directory

In addition, the <project>.gen/sources_1/ip/mig/mig/example_design
directory contains some files that we need for simulation purposes:

- The sim/ddr3_model.sv and sim/ddr3_model_parameters.vh files
- The sim/wiredly.v file

Finally, we need the MIG parameters from user_design/rtl/mig_mig.v,
they are copied over into sdram.vh.

NOTE: at the moment SIM_BYPASS_INIT_CAL is "FAST" and should be "OFF"
once we have tested that it works OK with "OFF".

The only custom file here is sdram.sv which bundles together the MIG
PHY plus the various clocking modules and exposes a very low-level
interface.
